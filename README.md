# coursedaft
a  dirty, young tool to convert swf/pf (*cough* coursesmart)"back" to pdf

#features
it is a barebone(in the sense that it currently has very few loaders and processors for converting a whole pf back into the pdf it has once been), but complete(in the sense that it does an exact conversion,most prominently preserving clipping paths and , needless to say, all fonts, in unicode, for the better) pf(i.e, PageFidel, a bastardization of pdf into swf to make it unusably unportable) to pdf converter. it does also convert swf, but only if it falls in the pf action domain. otherwise, the"swf" part is merely a beard term. sorry for the contrieved description. i'm half-retard, at my best.

#how it is used
* (i'm literally obsessed about the word <hr0m3 so my apologies beforehand in case it causes you cofnusion -- i'm also obsessed about f's following n's ; they always precede it in my prose, even when they must not.)
first go and grab yourself a google <hr0m3 (or, equally, "a chrome"); in case there is a <hr0m3 already installed on your machine, then great. all you have to do is to optionally clear its cache in order to make your task of trudging among the pdf's pages much easier (oxymoron intended, though it could be ignord.)

* open <hr0m3 and go to sean devine's crapsite. it is mostly located on the coursesmart.com thing.


* sign in, or signup and then sign in.



* chckout ebook (no article to modify "ebook" means you can check out any ebook; i promise i will use "an" to convey this meaning, from now on   .)





















* find where the <hr0m3's cache is located on your machine. if unsure, go and search "Application Cache" and when it got found, go in it and find Cache folder.


















* go in the Cache folder, and copy into it the convert.py along with the intercourse folder.






















































* run it on a python3. when the program dies, naturally or else, it'd be survivd by a "coursedaft.pdf" containing all its achievements.









* finally, be warned; this is an early beta scale project ( i.e, something like a microsoft RC product, or a shippn App\*e one.). use it at all but your own risk; all your feedback is most appreciated, either by filing issues on this site or droppn me a mail on "icefapperatlarrydotcom"(replace larry with gmai*); your help would especially be a must in aiding me clean up the mess i've made. thanks a lot for reading this long.
